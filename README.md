My colleagues and I were tasked to make a phone book app in python for our Data Structures and Algorithms class.(https://github.com/PYAG1/phone-book-python-group-work)
https://github.com/frimpsss and I decided to transform this group project into our personal project using React.Js to help improve our front-end dev skills.
This app uses React forms and React useState to allow you to add/store a number, displays the list of contacts, delete contacts and search for a contact.
